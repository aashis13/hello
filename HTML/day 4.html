<p><b><u>Computer</u></b> is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical 
    operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers can perform generic 
    sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide range of tasks. </p>

    <b><i><u>A broad</u></i></b> range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose
     devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as are factory devices like industrial robots
      and computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices like
     smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links billions of other computers and users.

    <b><i>Early computers</i></b> were meant to be used only for calculations. Simple manual instruments like the abacus have
     aided people in doing calculations since ancient times. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical
    devices were built to automate long, tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated 
    electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic
    calculating machines were developed during World War II. The first semiconductor transistors in the late 1940s
    were followed by the silicon-based MOSFET (MOS transistor) and monolithic integrated circuit chip technologies
     in the late 1950s, leading to the microprocessor and the microcomputer revolution in the 1970s. The speed, power
    and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing
     at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries.
